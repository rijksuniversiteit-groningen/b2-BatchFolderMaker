# Batch Folder Maker

The Batch Folder Maker creates for all students of a course a folder in the course content of the content System. The permissions are set such that each
student can access its own folder and the instructor can access all folders of the course. It is also possible to create an additional level of folders for the groups in a course. An instructor is free to define the folder permissions of each level (group, student). This supports different use cases, like letting students reviewing each other works within group by giving read permissions to group members.

There is also a system tool ("Copyright Police"), in which authorized persons can review all instructor uploaded content.
